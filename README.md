#Order System
This Order System was developed for my Software Engineering class at Griffith. 
The System was Developed by Matthew Lee and Myself (Adam Pyle)
It was built using the Laravel PHP framework and incoporates the following resources:
* [Laravel 5.1](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1)
* [Jquery 2.1.1](https://jquery.com/download/)
* [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/)

Design documents for the project can be provided on request.

Below is the Readme for when the project was in production

#2509ICT - Software Engineering

This is the repo for the Order System for Software engineering.
It will be developed on the Laravel platform

The project will use the bug/feature tracker implemented into bitbucket. All
features/function points will be added to the tracker so that commits can be linked.

**Live version with master can be found here:** OR http://order.getset.tech/

#WORKSPACE SETUP
After cloning this repo to your workspace of choice there is a script I've made which will setup the basic tools.
this will setup and install composer along with setting some environment variables.
You will need to `chmod +x workspace_init.sh`
Then `./workspace_init.sh`
you will also need to run `composer install` in the laravel root
